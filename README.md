Program Description:
This program is a simple encryption and decryption tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom algorithm. It prompts the user to choose between encryption, decryption, or exiting the program, and then performs the corresponding operation based on user input.

Program Functionality:
- Encrypt: Users can input a message to be encrypted. The program generates a random key, calculates a numerical value based on the key's characters, and uses this value as the encryption key.
- Decrypt: Users can input an encrypted message along with the decryption key. The program converts the key into a numerical value and uses it to decrypt the message.
- Exit: Users can choose to exit the program.
